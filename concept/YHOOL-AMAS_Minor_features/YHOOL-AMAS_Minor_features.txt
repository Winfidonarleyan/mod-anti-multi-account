1 NEW CHECKS

1.1 EXPLORED ZONES

Analyse the data from the column “exploredZones” in the database “
characters”, in the table “characters”.

See this for more explanation: 
https://github.com/Winfidonarleyan/mod-anti-multi-account/issues/3

(I have a backup of the issue just in case)

2 CHECKS TO IMPROVE

2.1 IMPROVED IP

If there are multiple accounts with the same full IP only, then 
it awards more points.

Example:

Account 1 has IP aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa -> 20 pts

Account 2 has IP aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa -> 20 pts

Account 3 has IP aaa.aaa.aaa.zzz -> 10 pts



.amas full Barbz

IP: 164.154.101.244 Perfect match (2) | 40 pts

3 GM COMMANDS

3.1 IMPROVED OUTPUT

Open the file “Improved_command_output.yml” (because YAML syntax 
highlighting is good :P). It shows how it can be improved

The problem is how to align values ingame, it would prob need 
some custom C++ function to fill the correct number of empty 
spaces (since TABS don't work).

Quote from Rochet2:

Well, you could do that with sprintf for example. You can control 
the width of the output, so you pick a max width and then the 
text is formatted to that width with rest being 0 or spaces etc. 
I dont really like such stuff myself though

3.2 IMPROVED .AMAS LIST

.amas list -> list below subcommands (normally it's default when 
filling “command” table in the db)

.amas list suspicious all -> list ALL suspicious players' names. 
They are separated between OFFLINE and ONLINE

.amas list suspicious online -> list only the ONLINE suspicious 
players

.amas list suspicious offline -> list only the OFFLINE suspicious 
players

.amas list guilty -> list only the guilty players (so probably 
banned)

.amas list all -> list ALL suspicious AND guilty players' names. 
They are separated between suspicious and guilty.

3.3 ADDITIONAL .AMAS COMMENT

.amas comment read #commentID -> Read that comment
