1.1 Technical sheet

• Name: yhool-amas

• Full name: Anti-Multi Account System

1.2 Concept

Detect multi-account users.

• The system must perform checks on certain data and attribute a 
  rating to the result (in the form of points).

• The points should be easily configurable/tweakable in a config 
  file

• After all checks have been done, an account which have a rating 
  of 110 points means it's a highly suspicious account (suspected 
  of multi account usage) and a warning is sent to GMs and stored 
  in the DB. We might even automatically ban accounts with high 
  rating but we wont tell the player the exact reasons of the ban 
  of course.

• If the account has a rating of 50, the account might be on 
  watch.

• If the account has a rating of 10 points, it probably is a 
  normal account, so no problem.

• More points = more suspicious = bad!

We should find a formula for most checks to compare to an average 
or a predetermined value.

Gmail spam filter :P

1.4 Goal

Multi account completely ruins the immersion and the gameplay.
