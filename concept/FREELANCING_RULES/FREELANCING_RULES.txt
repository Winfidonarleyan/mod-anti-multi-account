FREELANCING RULES

1 RULES

1.1 GENERAL

• You must focus on the “Major features” first (if there are 
  several projects linked together, you must first do the “Major 
  features” of each project), then work on the “Minor features”. 
  Then at the end, we will deal with “Polishing” and tweaking.

1.2 GIT

• Each commit = one feature

• Commits must have a useful name and description

1.3 CODING

1.3.1 General

• NO DUPLICATE DATA - NO HARDCODED SHIT - MAKE USE OF THE CONCEPT 
  OF INHERITANCE: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/inheritance

• Stick to one naming convention (my favourite being: 
  NAME_VARIABLE)

• Divide files into smaller files if they become too 
  big/unmanageable. Example: make a configuration.cpp file for a 
  CPP module

1.4 MySQL

• Set the correct data types for the columns to have a performing 
  and lighter database.

• Try to make only one SQL query as much as possible (when using 
  the same hook for multiple operations, for example).

1.5 PAYMENT

• I pay at the end of the job.
